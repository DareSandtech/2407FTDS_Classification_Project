## 1. Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>

Your team has been hired as data science consultants for a news outlet to create news classification models using Python and deploy it as a web application with Streamlit. 
The aim is to provide you with a hands-on demonstration of applying machine learning techniques to natural language processing tasks.  This end-to-end project encompasses the entire workflow, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and final deployment. The primary stakeholders for the news classification project for "The Indian Express" could include the editorial team, IT/tech support, management, readers, etc. These groups are interested in improved content categorization, operational efficiency, and enhanced user experience.


## 2. Dataset <a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>
The dataset is comprised of news articles that need to be classified into categories based on their content, including `Business`, `Technology`, `Sports`, `Education`, and `Entertainment`.

**Dataset Features:**
| **Column**                                                                                  | **Description**              
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------   
| Headlines   | 	The headline or title of the news article.
| Description | A brief summary or description of the news article.
| Content | The full text content of the news article.
| URL | The URL link to the original source of the news article.
| Category | The category or topic of the news article (e.g., business, education, entertainment, sports, technology).

## 3. Packages <a class="anchor" id="packages"></a>

To carry out all the objectives for this repo, the following necessary dependencies were loaded:
+ `Pandas 2.2.2` and `Numpy 1.26`
+ `Matplotlib 3.8.4`
 

## 4. Environment <a class="anchor" id="environment"></a>

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment for your projects, there are many ways to do this; we've outlined one such method below. Make sure to regularly update this section. This way, anyone who clones your repository will know exactly what steps to follow to prepare the necessary environment. The instructions provided here should enable a person to clone your repo and quickly get started.

### Create the new evironment - you only need to do this once

```bash
# create the conda environment
conda create --name <env>
```

### This is how you activate the virtual environment in a terminal and install the project dependencies

```bash
# activate the virtual environment
conda activate <env>
# install the pip package
conda install pip
# install the requirements for this project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Streamlit<a class="anchor" id="streamlit"></a>

To fork the repo, simply ensure that you are logged into your GitHub account, and then click on the 'fork' button at the top of this page as indicated within the figure above.

### What is Streamlit?

This repository forms the basis of *Task 2* for the **Classification Predict** within EDSA's Data Science course. It hosts template code which will enable students to deploy a basic [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) web application.

Streamlit is a framework that acts as a web server with dynamic visuals, multiple responsive pages, and robust deployment of your models. :star:

In its own words:
> Streamlit ... is the easiest way for data scientists and machine learning engineers to create beautiful, performant apps in only a few hours!  All in pure Python. All for free.

> Itâ€™s a simple and powerful app model that lets you build rich UIs incredibly quickly.

Streamlit takes away much of the background work needed in order to get a platform which can deploy your models to clients and end users. Meaning that you get to focus on the important stuff (related to the data), and can largely ignore the rest. This will allow you to become a lot more productive.  

##### Description of files

For this repository, we are only concerned with a single file:

| File Name              | Description                       |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------             |
| `base_app.py`          | Streamlit application definition. |


#### 5.1 Running the Streamlit web app on your local machine

As a first step to becoming familiar with our web app's functioning, we recommend setting up a running instance on your own local machine. To do this, follow the steps below by running the given commands within a Git bash (Windows), or terminal (Mac/Linux):

- Ensure that you have the prerequisite Python libraries installed on your local machine:

 ```bash
 pip install -U streamlit numpy pandas scikit-learn
 ```

- Clone the *forked* repo to your local machine.

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/{your-account-name}/2401FTDS_Classification_Project.git
 ```  

- Navigate to the base of the cloned repo, and start the Streamlit app.

 ```bash
 cd classification-predict-streamlit-template/
 streamlit run base_app.py
 ```

 If the web server was able to initialise successfully, the following message should be displayed within your bash/terminal session:

```
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

    Local URL: http://localhost:8501
    Network URL: http://192.168.43.41:8501
```
